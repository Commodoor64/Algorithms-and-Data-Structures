Github isn't letting me store empty folders in here.

In my program all of the empty folders are created in the "code" folder

I used the makefolder.py to turn a simple go program into folder names but it doesn't properly turn the initial spaces into underscores so I did that manually.

test.go is the file with the origional code I used to test the program. 

you can already find this in the makefolder.py and compiler.go files but this is how I translated special characters not allowed in folder names:

/ -> {slash}
: -> {col}
* -> {star}
" -> {quote}
< -> {leftcarrot}
> ->{rightcarrot}

all spaces before the code begins on each line is replaced with underscores(this is because I initially started with writing the folders in python but switched after having difficulty runnig the file in go)

as far as my limited go knowledge goes, line 65 in the compiler.go file should delete the run.go file created to run the code after running the file. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.
