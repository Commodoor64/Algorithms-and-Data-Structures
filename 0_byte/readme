Github isn't letting me store empty folders in here.

In my program all of the empty folders are created in the "code" folder

I used the makefolder.py to turn a simple go program into folder names but it doesn't properly turn the initial spaces into underscores so I did that manually.

test.go is the file with the origional code I used to test the program. 

you can already find this in the makefolder and compiler(main) files but this is how I translated special characters not allowed in folder names:

/ -> {slash}
: -> {col}
* -> {star}
" -> {quote}
< -> {leftcarrot}
> ->{rightcarrot}
